Hi Piotr,Well after i launched the app,i was sleeping 9hrs in 2 days(3 shifts of 3 hrs each in 2 days),the rest of the time i was sending emails and spamming on facebook groups.I also asked youtubers to do a video review so that more and more people can have a look at my app.I think i sent 300+ emails a day 
This happened for 20 days.Now i am getting 700+ downloads a day without even promoting it manually .

Also the screenshots i used were very good so that whoever sees the app,downloads it. 
Here is the link by the way

I am the mother of an 1.5 year old son. I am also a professional application developer. Since I was not completely satisfied with the toddler applications I found in the appstore, I decided to make one myself. This is the result. I hope your kid enjoys it as much as my son does!
